                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    In the forested highlands of Mindanao, Indigenous healer Mingay Dakias of the Manobo-Dulangan community continues to rely on traditional forest medicines — leaves, roots, and vines — to treat everyday illnesses such as wounds, stomachaches, and skin problems. Passed down through generations, this plant-based knowledge remains vital for Indigenous peoples living far from hospitals and modern clinics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A new nationwide study led by Prof. Krizler Tanalgo of the University of Southern Mindanao, published in Integrative Conservation, documented 796 medicinal plant species used by 34 ethnolinguistic groups across the Philippines. The research highlights how traditional medicine serves as both a healthcare system and a conservation practice, relying on sustainable harvesting and deep respect for nature.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Experts warn, however, that this knowledge is at risk due to deforestation, illegal logging, and lack of documentation. Ethnobotanist Dr. Grecebio Jonathan Alejandro of the University of Santo Tomas emphasized the need to integrate traditional practices into formal health systems while protecting Indigenous rights and biodiversity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Government initiatives such as the Traditional and Alternative Medicine Act of 1997 and the Philippine Institute of Traditional and Alternative Health Care (PITAHC) exist, but implementation remains limited. Only a few herbs like lagundi, ampalaya, and sambong have been scientifically validated and officially endorsed by the Department of Health.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Researchers urge the government to support community-based documentation, equitable partnerships, and stronger forest protection to safeguard both biodiversity and Indigenous heritage. Tanalgo’s team has created the Herbolario database to digitally preserve ethnobotanical knowledge.

                    For Dakias and his people, protecting their ancestral forests means preserving both their medicine and culture. “If our forests are destroyed, we lose our medicine,” Dakias said — a reminder that traditional knowledge and environmental conservation are inseparable in the Philippines.
