                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Health experts and advocates are calling for urgent and coordinated efforts to address the growing burden of type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the Philippines. In observance of National Diabetes Awareness Week, medical specialists emphasized that these two diseases are closely linked and are among the country's leading causes of illness and death.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Experts warned that many Filipinos are diagnosed only when complications have already developed, making treatment more difficult and costly. They underscored the need for early screening programs, especially for individuals with risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and a family history of diabetes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The call to action also focused on promoting healthier lifestyles, including balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, and proper disease management. Public health advocates urged both government agencies and private organizations to invest in community-based education campaigns and improve access to diagnostic and treatment services, particularly in rural and low-income areas.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By prioritizing early detection and prevention, experts believe the Philippines can significantly reduce the rising cases of diabetes and CKD, ease the pressure on the healthcare system, and improve the overall well-being of Filipino communities.
