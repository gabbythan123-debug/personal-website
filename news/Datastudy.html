                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    The Philippine Cancer Society (PCS) reported that the Philippine delegation played a leadership role during the United Nations High-Level Week on Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) held in 2025. The meeting aimed to adopt a new Political Declaration to strengthen global efforts to prevent and control major NCDs such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and chronic lung disease.
                </p>

                <p>
                    According to the PCS, the Philippines showed strong leadership by representing Filipino priorities and promoting the inclusion of cancer control within the broader NCD agenda. The delegation emphasized the importance of multi-sector cooperation, civil society participation, and the need to amplify the voices of people living with NCDs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The article highlighted that the Political Declaration retained commitments to fight cancer, including goals like the elimination of cervical cancer and improving childhood cancer survival rates. However, the report also noted that the declaration’s preventive measures—such as taxing unhealthy products—were weaker than what health advocates had hoped for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    PCS stressed that this international participation gives the Philippines an opportunity to align national NCD strategies with global standards and to attract technical and financial support. The organization urged that the momentum from the UN meeting should be used to strengthen local policies, improve funding for NCD programs, and coordinate actions across various government sectors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In conclusion, the PCS called for the Philippines to continue demonstrating leadership by turning these global commitments into real national progress, ensuring better prevention, treatment, and care for people affected by non-communicable diseases.
