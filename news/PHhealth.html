                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>MANILA, Philippines</strong> — The country’s total health expenditure rose by 17 percent in 2024 as both income and government spending for health care increased.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that total health expenditures, at current prices, amounted to ₱1.56 trillion last year, up from ₱1.33 trillion in 2023. The PSA reported that every Filipino spent an average of ₱12,751 for health care in 2024 — an 18-percent increase from the ₱10,840 average in 2023.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Total health expenditure accounted for 5.9 percent of the country’s gross domestic product in 2024, up from 5.5 percent the previous year.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. chief economist Michael Ricafort said the rise could be partly attributed to higher incomes, improved demographics, and increased employment that allowed more Filipinos to spend on health care. He also pointed to the expansion and modernization of medical facilities and higher government health spending, especially for indigent families, as drivers of the increase.
                </p>

                <p>
                    PSA data showed that current health expenditures made up 92.2 percent of total expenditure, while health capital formation accounted for the remaining 7.8 percent. Current health expenditures grew by 19 percent to ₱1.44 trillion in 2024 from ₱1.21 trillion in 2023, while health capital formation inched up 1.7 percent to ₱121.48 billion from ₱119.45 billion.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Among financing schemes, government schemes and compulsory contributory health care financing had the largest share of current health expenditure at 44.7 percent, followed by household out-of-pocket payments at 42.7 percent and voluntary health care payment schemes at 12.6 percent.
